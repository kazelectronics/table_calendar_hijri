# TableCalendar Hijri Edition

port of https://pub.dev/packages/table_calendar with Hijri added.

To do list:
- gregorian as main, hijri as second works, however:
	- needs adjustdays implemented.
	- days dont line up in previous months since lunar calendar shifts depending on location in the world.
- hijri calendar only or as main does not work:
	- focus days incorrect
	- starting day bug 
	- months not moving correctly
